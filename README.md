Bash script that adds Git Verion Control information into files and pushes them to GitHub, Bitbucket, and/or GitLab.

## Goal
Answer one question over the phone by looking at the code; ***What version are you running?**

#### If you like this repository, select in the upper-right corner, star, thank you.

## Description
Markit is a bash script that is a wrapper around these Git commands; git add ${FILE_NAME}, git commit -m "${FILE_MESSAGE}", git tag -a ${RELEASE_VERSION}, and git push â€“follow-tags. It automates this Git commit process and adds two comment lines of metadata about file changes to all tracked modified files in your local Git repository.  This metadata allows any person to answer the question; What version are you running? 

Markit supports [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) and alphanumeric versioning (v0.1.64-alpha).  Markit will display the current version before prompting you to enter the next version.  Markit includes the number of commits with the version in the file(s).  I find this helpful when commiting several different changes while working on the same PATCH.

If environment variable MARKITLOCAL is set to 1, markit automates this git commit process, but does not push to GitHub repository or Bitbucket repository or GitLab project.  I find this helpful when working without network access to a remote Git repository.  If using the bash shell, enter; 'export MARKITLOCAL=1' on the command line to set the MARKITLOCAL environment variable to '1'.  Use the command, 'unset MARKITLOCAL' to remove the exported information from the MARKITLOCAL environment variable.  You are on your own defining environment variables if you are using other shells.

The two comment lines of metadata include:

 * file_name, file_version.commits, date, remote_repository, developer, hostname, parent git-tag-commit_number-hash
 * a one line breif description about the changes
 
Markit currently supports files with these file extensions:

c(c), C++(cc|cpp|c++|cxx), C header(h|H|hpp), C++ header(hxx|Hxx|HXX), Go(go), HTML(html|htm), Java(java|class|jar), JavaScript(js), Kotlin(kt|kts), Makefile(mk|MK), Pascal(p|pp|paa), Perl(pl|PL|psh), PHP(php|php3|php4|ph3|ph4), PowerShell(ps1|msh), Python(py), R(R), Ruby(rb), Rust(rs|rlib), Scala(scala|sc), Shell(sh|bash|csh|tcsh|ksh), Terraform(tf|tfstate), Text(txt), XML(xml), YAML(yml|yaml)

Markit currently supports these files without file extensions: Dockerfile, Makefile.  There will be a prompt to add comment character(s) for unknown file names when needed and a prompt to add a description about the changes.
     
## Objectives
* Any person without knowledge of Git or GitHub or Bitbucket or GitLab or markit to be able to answer one question; 
  **What version are you running?**
* Supports [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) and alphanumeric versioning (v0.1.64-alpha)
* Only update modified files by inserting two comment lines with metadata
* Insert the lines of metadata after the first line in files
* Support GitHub
* Use git commit message as part of metadata
* Use git tag as part of metadata
* Include date and remote Git repository as part of metadata
* Include path with filename in remote Git repository as part of metadata
* Don't create any requirements for markit other than the version and those required by Git
* Support several file extensions for comment character
* Support Bitbucket or GitLab
* Support Git local repository without network access (without 'git push')
* Support push to multiple Git remote repositories at once (edit .git/config)
* Need to test with [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) (Prevents you from committing passwords and other sensitive information to a Git repository), should work [git-hound](https://github.com/ezekg/git-hound) (Git plugin that prevents sensitive data from being committed.)  [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog) (Searches through git repositories for high entropy strings and secrets, digging deep into commit history)
* I use alias release-notes='git log --graph --pretty=format:'\''%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset'\'' --abbrev-commit' to help build release notes

## Clone
To clone this repository, change to a directory you want to download the files into.  If you do not have Git installed then enter; "sudo apt-get install git" if using Ubuntu. Other Linux distribution install methods can be found here: https://git-scm.com/download/linux.  On the GitHub page of this script use the "HTTPS clone URL" with the 'git clone' command.  Copy markit and check-markit to a directory that is included in your PATH (/usr/local/bin, ~/bin).

    git clone https://github.com/BradleyA/markit
    cd markit
    cp -p {./markit,./check-markit,./find-code.sh} /usr/local/bin
    cd ..
    rm -r ./markit

## Usage: markit
Mark **tracked modified file(s)**, in your local Git repository and push those changes to remote Git repository.

    markit 

## Output: markit

    $ markit
    Files to be marked and pushed to remote Git repository:

    testfiles/sample.sh

    Current Git repository release number:  3.196
    Enter release number to commit files (example 3.41.7) or ctrl-c to stop.

    3.197
    
    Using release number:  3.197

    Enter a one line description about the changes or ctrl-c to stop.
        (example: Added logic for --help; closes #12, resolves #14):
 
    test markit for sample.sh

        testfiles/sample.sh     sh

## Usage: check-markit
Check the release version of a file with the remote Git repository release version.  The **check-markit** script allows you to check if there is a newer release version of a file.  The following example uses the file 'markit', but can be used with any file that was marked with markit.

    check-markit markit 

## Output: check-markit
    $ check-markit markit

## Getting Started
**Fork https://github.com/BradleyA/markit** repository so you can modify the test files while learning how simple it is to work with markit.  

On your system, git clone the forked copy of markit from \<YOUR-REPOSITORY\>.  

    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-REPOSITORY>/markit.git

Change into clone directory on your system.

    cd markit

Make a change to testfiles/sample.sh.

    edit testfiles/sample.sh
    
Run ./markit to tag, commit, and push the change in testfiles/sample.sh to your local and remote Git repositories.  Enter the next version number when prompted and a brief description of the changes to testfiles/sample.sh.  You will be prompted for your password when Git pushes testfiles/sample.sh to your remote Git repository.  **That is it!**

    ./markit

Check if your local version of testfiles/sample.sh is the same version that is on your remote Git repository.

    ./check-markit -f ./testfiles/sample.sh

On GitHub go to your Forked markit repository settings page and check the box next to Issues. Then open the first issue on your markit repository, #1.

Make a change to testfiles/sample.sh

    edit testfiles/sample.sh

Run ./markit.  Enter the next version number when prompted and this brief description '[testing markit issue changes close #1](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)'.  You will be prompted for your GitHub password when git pushes testfiles/sample.sh to your remote Git repository.

    ./markit
    
The file testfiles/sample.sh has been updated with metadata, git tag, git commit, git push, and the issue #1 on GitHub has been [closed](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/).

View ./markit help pages to learn more about how markit works with tracked and untracked files and without network access to remote Git repository. 

    ./markit --help

Continue testing with the other test files to help you integrate markit with your development solutions.  Open a GitHub issue and then modify two test files.   When running markit enter a message and include the GitHub issue number and GitHub will update the issue.

## Install
